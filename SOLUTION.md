So to explain where would I take the feature post-submission it'd take more data on what and how it needs to do things.

Points to work on:

1. Structure
2. Integration

Both of them relate to the architecture where the first one talk more about how code is structured internally. There is a lot to do as of right now since I believe that the most simple code for test task is better than the wrong abstraction.

The second one implies public interface of the feature and how would it be integrated into the project.

Overall, the idea is to expand solution for internal (edge cases, error handling etc.) and external (integration) use.
